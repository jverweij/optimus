optimus
=======

service for xml validation and transformation

will be a regular java webapp based on saxon

the service will allow you to call validation based on .xsd
transformation will be done using .xslt
will add paths to search for .xsd, .xml or .xslt
will add caching for both compiled .xslt and converted .xml
will add rules so .xslt will be choosen based on path/location and/or xpath expressions within the .xml.

all I need... is some time work on this thing.

O yeah, the name, since this is the transformation walhala I thought a reference to transformers Optimus Prime would be nice.
